# Feature development workflow

## Workflow Steps

### [x] Step: Requirements

Your job is to generate a Product Requirements Document based on the feature description,

First, analyze the provided feature definition and determine unclear aspects. For unclear aspects: - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if: - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications - No reasonable default exists - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details

Ask up to 5 most priority clarifications to the user. Then, create the document following this template:

```
# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]


## User Stories*


### User Story 1 - [Brief Title]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

```

Save the PRD into `h:\My Drive\Jennifer's Files\School\University of Texas at Austin\Personal\Planner\.zencoder\chats\94672179-7072-4401-ac6c-c25b01656865/requirements.md`.

### [x] Step: Technical Specification

Based on the PRD in `h:\My Drive\Jennifer's Files\School\University of Texas at Austin\Personal\Planner\.zencoder\chats\94672179-7072-4401-ac6c-c25b01656865/requirements.md`, create a detailed technical specification to be used by a coding agent to implement the feature. Follow this template:

```
# Technical Specification: [FEATURE]

## Technical Context
Language/Version, primary dependencies, etc

## Technical Implementation Brief

Summarize key technical decisions for implementing the feature. Make sure they take into account the existing code as much as possible.

## Source Code Structure

## Contracts

Define addition or changes in data models, DB schemas, APIs, code interfaces etc

## Delivery Phases

Define several incremental deliverables for the feature. Each should be a minimal viable product testable end-to-end.

## Verification Strategy

Define how the coding agent can verify each deliverable it creates. Provide instructions for the agent to perform the verification using available tools (lint/test commands, bash commands) and create helper scripts and tools for more complex result verification.
The verification for each deliverable should be executable by a coding agent using built-in capabilities (lint and test commands from the project, bash commands), pre-generated helper scripts or MCP servers. Research and add to the spec:

- MCP servers that should be installed to help the agent with the verification

- helper scripts that need to be generated in the first phases of the plan to verify complex scenarios that can't be covered by the tests in the project's test framework(s)

- any sample input artifact(s) that are required for verification. Note if these artifacts can be a) generated by the agent; b) discovered by the agent on line; c) must be provided by the user.
```

Save the spec to `h:\My Drive\Jennifer's Files\School\University of Texas at Austin\Personal\Planner\.zencoder\chats\94672179-7072-4401-ac6c-c25b01656865/spec.md`.

### [x] Step: Implementation Plan

Based on the technical spec in `h:\My Drive\Jennifer's Files\School\University of Texas at Austin\Personal\Planner\.zencoder\chats\94672179-7072-4401-ac6c-c25b01656865/spec.md`, create a detailed task plan and update `h:\My Drive\Jennifer's Files\School\University of Texas at Austin\Personal\Planner\.zencoder\chats\94672179-7072-4401-ac6c-c25b01656865/plan.md`. Each task should have task definition, references to contracts to be used/implemented, deliverable definition and verification instructions.

### [ ] Step: Audit nav pill styles
Identify global nav pill classes/custom properties in `css/opus-core.css`; record default/hover/focus/active colors and radius to satisfy interaction and styling contracts. Deliverable: notes of class names/properties to reuse. Verification: confirm classes/properties exist and match nav appearance in core CSS.

### [ ] Step: Update CSEA CTA markup
Adjust `html/csea.html` CTA to place Grievance Form (with link icon) and Meeting Notes in a single centered flex row. Preserve labels and icon per UI contract. Deliverable: updated markup with grouped container. Verification: open file to ensure structure places two links/buttons together and icon remains on Grievance Form.

### [ ] Step: Apply pill styling and layout constraints
Reuse nav pill classes or add minimal rules in `css/csea.css` to apply pill shape, colors, and interaction states to both buttons; enforce no-wrap centered flex layout with spacing and safe padding to avoid overflow. Deliverable: CSS updates ensuring one-line centered pills with nav state parity. Verification: view `html/csea.html` at narrow/wide widths; ensure no wrap/overflow and hover/focus/active match nav.

### [ ] Step: Responsive and accessibility validation
Manually verify in browser that both pills remain on one line at all viewport sizes, focus styles mirror nav, and tab order is intact. Deliverable: visual/behavioral confirmation of layout and states. Verification: Live Server/file URL checks with hover/focus/active interactions and viewport resizing.

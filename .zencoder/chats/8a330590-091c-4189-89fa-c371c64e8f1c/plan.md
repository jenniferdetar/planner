# Feature development workflow

## Workflow Steps

### [x] Step: Requirements

Your job is to generate a Product Requirements Document based on the feature description,

First, analyze the provided feature definition and determine unclear aspects. For unclear aspects: - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if: - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications - No reasonable default exists - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details

Ask up to 5 most priority clarifications to the user. Then, create the document following this template:

```
# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]


## User Stories*


### User Story 1 - [Brief Title]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

```

Save the PRD into `/Users/jenniferdetar/Desktop/Planner/.zencoder/chats/8a330590-091c-4189-89fa-c371c64e8f1c/requirements.md`.

### [x] Step: Technical Specification

Based on the PRD in `/Users/jenniferdetar/Desktop/Planner/.zencoder/chats/8a330590-091c-4189-89fa-c371c64e8f1c/requirements.md`, create a detailed technical specification to be used by a coding agent to implement the feature. Follow this template:

```
# Technical Specification: [FEATURE]

## Technical Context
Language/Version, primary dependencies, etc

## Technical Implementation Brief

Summarize key technical decisions for implementing the feature. Make sure they take into account the existing code as much as possible.

## Source Code Structure

## Contracts

Define addition or changes in data models, DB schemas, APIs, code interfaces etc

## Delivery Phases

Define several incremental deliverables for the feature. Each should be a minimal viable product testable end-to-end.

## Verification Strategy

Define how the coding agent can verify each deliverable it creates. Provide instructions for the agent to perform the verification using available tools (lint/test commands, bash commands) and create helper scripts and tools for more complex result verification.
The verification for each deliverable should be executable by a coding agent using built-in capabilities (lint and test commands from the project, bash commands), pre-generated helper scripts or MCP servers. Research and add to the spec:

- MCP servers that should be installed to help the agent with the verification

- helper scripts that need to be generated in the first phases of the plan to verify complex scenarios that can't be covered by the tests in the project's test framework(s)

- any sample input artifact(s) that are required for verification. Note if these artifacts can be a) generated by the agent; b) discovered by the agent on line; c) must be provided by the user.
```

Save the spec to `/Users/jenniferdetar/Desktop/Planner/.zencoder/chats/8a330590-091c-4189-89fa-c371c64e8f1c/spec.md`.

### [x] Step: Implementation Plan

1. Copy `public/html/finance.html` to `public/csea/finance.html`.
2. Update all CSS/JS paths to absolute paths.
3. Update sidebar: Set "CSEA" link to `active`, and make sub-page links relative to `/csea/`.
4. Verification: Run `grep` to check paths and sidebar links.

### [ ] Step: Implement public/csea/health.html
1. Copy `public/html/health.html` to `public/csea/health.html`.
2. Update all CSS/JS paths to absolute paths.
3. Update sidebar: Set "CSEA" link to `active`, and make sub-page links relative to `/csea/`.
4. Verification: Run `grep` to check paths and sidebar links.

### [ ] Step: Implement public/csea/hoa.html
1. Copy `public/html/hoa.html` to `public/csea/hoa.html`.
2. Update all CSS/JS paths to absolute paths.
3. Update sidebar: Set "CSEA" link to `active`, and make sub-page links relative to `/csea/`.
4. Verification: Run `grep` to check paths and sidebar links.

### [ ] Step: Implement public/csea/icaap.html
1. Overwrite `public/csea/icaap.html` with content from `public/html/icaap.html`.
2. Update all CSS/JS paths to absolute paths.
3. Update sidebar: Set "CSEA" link to `active`, and make sub-page links relative to `/csea/`.
4. Verification: Run `grep` to check paths and sidebar links.

### [ ] Step: Implement public/csea/planning.html

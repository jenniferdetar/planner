# January 2026 Planner Information

## Summary
Single-page static planner for January 2026 served as plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JavaScript. The page renders a monthly calendar fed by Supabase data (`calendar_by_date` table constrained to 2026-01-01 through 2026-01-31) merged with numerous static events (bills, committee meetings, quizzes, holidays, paydays, budget reminders). Styling is pill-based with Coming Soon handwriting font, using a stripe hero banner and colored weekday headers. A new Work Planner weekly view (Sunday-start) sits beside the Personal Planner, featuring priorities rows, checklist bands, and a timed grid with sample work blocks. No build tooling or package manager is used; assets load directly from CDNs. Deployment is static via Vercel with a rewrite funneling all routes to `index.html`.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Main and only application file. Contains inline styles defining color palette (sun-fri-sat hues, navy outlines, yellow accents), typography (Coming Soon), hero stripes, pill buttons for Personal/Work Planner anchors, monthly calendar grid (7-column, 140px row height), event pill styles (CSEA/LA Fed blue/yellow, payday/budget green/yellow, due red/yellow), and the Work Planner weekly layout. Embeds Supabase client init, event fetch/render logic, budget reminder calculation, static event list, and new work-week rendering (date range, priorities grids, to-do bands, hour-by-hour slots with sample notes).
- `vercel.json`: Static hosting configuration with `cleanUrls: true`, `buildCommand: null`, `installCommand: null`, `framework: null`, and a catch-all rewrite to `/index.html` for SPA-style deep links.
- `.zencoder/rules/`: Holds this repository overview. No additional workflows are defined.

## Language & Runtime
**Language**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (browser)  
**Version**: Standard browser runtime (no transpilation). Supabase client loaded from CDN `@supabase/supabase-js@2`.  
**Build System**: None (served as-is).  
**Package Manager**: None (no lockfile or manifest).

## Dependencies
**Main Dependencies**:
- `@supabase/supabase-js@2` via jsDelivr; used to call `createClient` and query the `calendar_by_date` table between 2026-01-01 and 2026-01-31.
- Google Fonts `Coming Soon` and `Plus Jakarta Sans` fetched from `fonts.googleapis.com/fonts.gstatic.com`.
- Browser DOM/Date APIs for rendering the monthly grid, aligning date keys, and generating the Work Planner weekly times.

**External Services**:
- Supabase project at `https://hhhuidbnvbtllxcaiusl.supabase.co` with public anon key embedded client-side; expects table `calendar_by_date` with at least `date` (ISO string) and `title` fields. RLS must permit the read scope used by the public client.

## Build & Installation
```bash
# No install or build steps
# Deploy or open index.html directly via static hosting
```
Deployment expectations: serve repository root statically; Vercel rewrite routes all requests to `/index.html` with clean URLs. No bundler or minifier is required.

## Main Files & Resources
- `index.html` key sections:
  - Hero banner with stripe bar, “BE REAL / not perfect” text, and pill links to Personal Planner (`#calendar`) and Work Planner (`#work-planner`).
  - Monthly calendar for January 2026: 7-column grid with colored weekday headers, tighter padding, uniform 140px rows, and pill-styled events. Static events include bills (HOA, mortgage, heloc, utilities, subscriptions), CSEA/LA Fed meetings, quizzes, travel, and holidays (New Year’s label, MLK textual entry). Supabase-fetched events merge by date via `getDateKey` (ISO slice) and are rendered with `getEventClass` keyword detection for payday/budget/due/CSEA/LA Fed coloring. Budget/Pay Bills reminders auto-insert 3 days before each payday via `getBudgetReminderDates`.
  - Work Planner weekly view starting Sunday (2026-01-04 to 2026-01-10 by default): range header, “Priorities & Encouragement” grid (three columns), reflection row (looking forward to, encourage, learn/read), “To-Do This Week” checklist row (four columns with MTWTFSS markers), and a 7-day timed grid (5am–8pm) generated by `renderWorkPlanner()` with sample work-note blocks (standup, 1:1s, sprint, outreach, retro, rest).
- Supabase config inlined within `index.html` with hard-coded URL and anon key; no environment variable indirection.
- Styling relies on CSS custom properties for weekday colors and shared border/text hues; no external stylesheet.

## Usage & Operations
- Open `index.html` in a browser or host statically (Vercel settings already provided). No dependency installation is necessary.
- Data flow: `fetchEvents()` queries Supabase, returning `data || []`; errors log to console and fall back to an empty list. `renderCalendar(events)` rebuilds the January grid on load, combining static and fetched events. `renderWorkPlanner()` runs on load to build the weekly work view.
- To adjust recurring/static items, edit `getStaticEvents(day)` for monthly items or `workHighlights`/text blocks in the work planner for weekly slots.
- To change date range for the Work Planner, update `workWeekStart` and the `workTimes` array if different hours are desired.

## Testing & Validation
- No automated tests, linters, or type checks are defined. Manual verification is required by opening `index.html` and confirming layout, Supabase fetch success, and proper rendering of pills, budget reminders, and the Work Planner grid.

## Project Structure
- Root contains only `index.html` and `vercel.json` for runtime behavior; no subpackages or multi-project layout.
- Hidden `.git` directory present for source control. `.zencoder` metadata holds repository summaries. No build artifacts or workflow configs are included.

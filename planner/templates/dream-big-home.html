                If you were to dream big for your home, family, and finances in 2026, what would you dream up?
                Would you love to brighten a room with fresh paint, clear out a closet, re-arrange furniture in oneroom in your home, or sell a few things to purchase something new that you've been dreaming about?
                Write down your 2026 list, and refer to it throughout the year to stay on track.
